I woke in the morning of sunday 2024 ready to join moringa school
I was very anxiuos to meet new people 
The orientation programme was good 
I am finally ready to join the tech space 

In the past my knowledge of tech was not better compared to know.
In the past tech advancements were a little behind not much had developed 
In the past not many people knew how to operate basic machines since not everybody had knowledge.

In the future times we expect a counrty with good leaders 
in the future, we expect to have better living standards 
In the future, we expect to have good infrastructure
In the future , we expect to have good medical systems
